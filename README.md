## Ruby Nested Iteration Practice

Starting with the CourseTest, then moving on to the SchoolTest, unskip tests as you come to them and make each of those tests pass.

As you work through this exercise, the classes will eventually respond to the interaction pattern below:

## Student

A student is assigned a house through an attr_accessor - `student.house = :house_name`.

```ruby
```


## Course

The `houses_represented` method should return an unique list of houses for the students enrolled in that course.

```ruby
```

## School

A school is created with a `name` and and list of `houses`.  When sorting a student, the school randomly assigns a house to that student.  The `sort_students` method should assign a house to every student enrolled in courses at that school.

```ruby
```
